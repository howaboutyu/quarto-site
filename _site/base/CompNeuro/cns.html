<p>To understand the basic properties of the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model and how noise causes the smoothing of f-I curves.</p>

<p>The LIF model is given by the following equation:</p>

<p>The firing rate of the neuron is given by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
1/f = \tau_m \ln \left(\frac{I R_m + E_L - V_{reset}}{I R_m + E_L - V_{th}}\right)
</span></p>
<p>Below I plot the equation for the firing rate of the neuron using the above equation and the firing rate of the neuron using the <em>LLF</em> equation. We can see that the firing rate of the neuron is very close to the firing rate of the neuron using the <em>LLF</em> equation. We can also see that the firing rate is 0 when the current is below the threshold current <span class="math inline">I_{th}=4nA</span>.</p>

<p>As we increase <span class="math inline">sigma_I</span> - proportional to the voltage noise - the firing rate close to <span class="math inline">I_{th}</span> increases. I think this might be due to cases where the voltage is close to the threshold voltage and the noise pushes the voltage over the threshold voltage. This is a hypothesis and I am not sure if this is correct.</p>
